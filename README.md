# human_walking_trajectory_prediction

## Prediction model

First, in this repository, a prediction model of human trajectory is implemented using an Optimal Control (OC) model.

## Walking Pattern Generator

Then, this prediction process is coupled with a Walking Pattern Generator (WPG) to generate a TALOS humanoid robot CoM and footsteps along the predicted trajectory. The data generated by this WPG can then be recorded and displayed.

## Installation

To run the OC model, you need to install this version of the crocoddyl library : https://github.com/imaroger/crocoddyl/tree/mybranch.
To run the WPG, you need to install the QPoases library for python as follows :
```bash
sudo apt-get install robotpkg-py27-qpoases 
```

This repository must be placed in a catkin workspace. The ROS version used to run this framework is ROS Melodic.

To run the whole prediction and footsteps generation process online, you just need to run the start.py code.
